# INTERSTELLAR GAMEJAM

## Idea
You're some dude with a paintball gun. Every planet is dying and turning grey like some coral reef acidification type sht. ur job is to paint them back to life.

you jump between planet to planet and add colours

maybe each planet has some like main key points that u fill up with colours fill the entire planet. like cores of crystals or smthn

maybe each planet gives u stat boosts or different paintball guns that do different sht


## Mechanics development wise
each planet randomly generated with colours, and then greyscaled

open-world, top down view but like. idea in my head to have sht further back appear to be "lower-down" giving a spherical effect as if ur moving AROUND the planet rather than across a flat surface.

have a paint roller or brush or smthn u can walk around with to paint the floor

grenade gun that u pop out paint bombs with

enemies (aliens) also greyscaled they damage u but also make the floor grey. when u give them colour they die or turn into planet decor
